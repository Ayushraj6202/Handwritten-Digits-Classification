# Handwritten-Digits-Classification
Project Title: Handwritten Digit Classification using Multilayer Neural Network  

In this project, a handwritten digit classification system was developed using a multilayer neural network. The dataset comprised 70,000 images, each represented as a grayscale value in a numpy array format. The neural network architecture consisted of four layers: an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer.

The primary objective was to train the neural network to accurately classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. After training the model using a portion of the dataset, the accuracy of the model was evaluated using a separate set of 10,000 images.

Through this approach, the performance of the neural network in correctly identifying handwritten digits was assessed, providing insights into the effectiveness of the model in real-world scenarios.
